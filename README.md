# Témpo

43% of undergrads, and 32% of grad students have sleep issues. Tempo is a web-based sleep app that offers you coupon rewards to sleep. It uses location, accelerometer, and microphone tracking to ensure that you are sleeping. Also, tempo’s competitive sleep tournaments are a social way to snooze. In addition, it will have a text-to-speech for motivational morning speeches from your phone, and a morning assistant in the future to get you going in the morning.
